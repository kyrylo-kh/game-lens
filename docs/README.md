# GameLens Engineering Roadmap

> **Note:** This document is the *engineering roadmap and principles overview* for GameLens.
> It sets out the architectural, technical, and risk management direction for the platform - not a user manual or quickstart guide.

## Vision

GameLens aims to unify and analyze data from major gaming sources (Steam, YouTube, Twitch, and more) to provide actionable insights and visualizations for developers, analysts, and gamers. The platform focuses on cost-efficiency, modularity, and extensibility, serving as a real-world showcase of modern data engineering best practices.

## Tech Stack

### Data Collection & Processing
- **Python:** `requests`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `clickhouse-driver`
- **Airflow:** DAGs for scheduled data fetch and ETL
- **Great Expectations:** Data validation & quality checks

### Storage & Analytics
- **AWS S3:** Data lake (Bronze / Silver / Gold layers)
- **Parquet:** Partitioned storage format
- **AWS Athena:** SQL analytics over the data lake
- **ClickHouse:** High-performance OLAP storage for BI queries

### BI & User Interface
- **Apache Superset:** Interactive dashboards (read-only for viewers)

### Monitoring & Alerts
- **Prometheus + Grafana:** Pipeline and database monitoring
- **Slack / Email Alerts:** Automated notifications for failures

### ML & AI
- **OpenAI API:** Automated daily insights generation
- **scikit-learn / Prophet:** Trend forecasting models

### Infrastructure
- **Hetzner VPS:** Hosting for ClickHouse, Airflow, and Superset
- **Docker:** Containerized services
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD for pipelines
- **Terraform (optional):** Infrastructure automation

> The following stack is selected for its balance of scalability, cost efficiency, and ease of integration.

## Architectural Principles

- **Separation of Layers:** Strict data lake layering (Bronze → Silver → Gold) ensures transparency, auditability, and reproducibility.
- **Modularity:** All pipelines, collectors, and transformations are modular and source-agnostic, enabling easy onboarding of new data sources.
- **Cost Optimization:** Leverage affordable cloud-native solutions, efficient scheduling, and dynamic prioritization to minimize resource usage.
- **Observability:** End-to-end monitoring, logging, and alerting for all pipelines and services.
- **Validation & Quality:** Automated, schema-driven data validation at every step (Great Expectations or equivalent).
- **Documentation-Driven Development:** Comprehensive, up-to-date docs (design decisions, data contracts, flowcharts) accompany all technical work.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** All infrastructure and deployments are automated and reproducible (Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform as applicable).

## Evolution Strategy

1. **Source-First Expansion:**
   Start with high-value sources (Steam, YouTube), then incrementally add new sources as required or as API access allows.
2. **Dynamic Prioritization:**
   Use score-based dynamic update schedules to keep “hot” games and new releases most up-to-date while minimizing API requests and costs.
3. **Unified Entity Modeling:**
   Build a unified catalog (`gamelens_game_id`) to enable reliable cross-source joins and analytics.
4. **Analytics-Ready Output:**
   Aggregate and enrich data in the Gold Layer, always optimizing for BI query speed and dashboard usability.
5. **Continuous Improvement:**
   Refactor and extend pipelines, add ML modules, and enhance dashboards as new insights and requirements emerge.

## Risk Management Philosophy

| Risk                                         | Likelihood | Impact   | Mitigation / Notes                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| API schema changes / deprecation              | High       | High     | Flexible data schemas, retry logic, regular API monitoring   |
| Increased AWS/S3/Athena/ClickHouse costs      | Medium     | High     | S3 lifecycle policies, dynamic partitioning, monitoring, resource auto-scaling |
| Rapid data volume growth                      | Medium     | Medium   | Partitioning, scalable OLAP storage, batch size optimization

*Risks are prioritized based on impact to data integrity, platform costs, and development velocity.*

## Extensibility & Future Directions

- Onboard new sources (Epic Games, Reddit, Metacritic) using the existing modular framework.
- Enable near-real-time analytics and streaming updates.
- Open APIs for community-driven dashboards or custom analytics.
- Experiment with advanced ML/AI modules (trend prediction, clustering, recommendations).

---

## Milestones & Next Steps (Optional)

- **MVP:** Ingest Steam and YouTube data, basic unified catalog, first dashboard.
- **Phase 2:** Add Twitch, extend analytics, improve cost controls.
- **Phase 3:** Launch external API, ML module prototype, support new data sources.
